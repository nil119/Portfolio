# GENIE – Intentional Wardrobe Companion

**Role:** Product / UX Designer (team of 4)  
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks (class project)  
**Team:** Shirley Guo, Sanjana Gurram, James Lee, Leo Li  
**My focus:** User research synthesis, interaction design, product strategy, pitch deck

## 1. Overview

Genie is a mobile app that helps young adults build a more intentional wardrobe.  
By tracking what they actually wear and intervening at online checkout, Genie reduces impulse purchases, increases cost-per-wear, and supports more sustainable consumption.

> **Tagline:** *Know what you wear. Buy what you’ll wear. Love what you wear.*

---

## 2. Problem

Despite overflowing closets, many young adults feel they have “nothing to wear.”  

We focused on:

- **Overbuying + underusing**  
  People wear about 20% of their clothes 80% of the time, leading to regret and wasted money.
- **Decision fatigue**  
  Online shopping surfaces endless options and trends, making it easy to impulse-buy for an “ideal future self” instead of real life.
- **Lack of visibility**  
  Most people don’t have a clear overview of what is actually in their wardrobe or how often they wear each item.

## 3. Target Users

- **Age:** 18–35  
- **Behavior:**
  - Mainly shop for clothes online
  - Often buy for special occasions or an “imagined” lifestyle
  - Frequently return items  
- **Goals:**
  - Buy less but buy better
  - Build a cohesive wardrobe that fits their real life
  - Feel less anxious and more in control of spending

## 4. Research & Insights

From our early research and synthesis, we identified several key insights:

- **Too many choices → impulse buy → regret**  
  Fast-fashion and algorithmic feeds constantly push new items, which users buy quickly and regret later.
- **Desire for low-effort tracking**  
  People like the *idea* of a digital wardrobe, but don’t want to manually log every item. They want something “semi-automatic.”
- **Different motivation styles**  
  Some users love data, streaks, and stats; others prefer quiet, private tracking with minimal gamification.
- **Stakeholder tension**
  - Users want to save money and mental energy.
  - Friends can give honest feedback but don’t want to be spammed to “vote on outfits.”
  - Brands and resale platforms benefit when purchases are more intentional and returns decrease.

These insights guided our design principles.

## 5. Design Principles

1. **Low effort, high awareness**  
   One quick daily action should unlock rich wardrobe insights.
2. **Nudge at the right moment**  
   Interventions should happen *before* the impulse purchase is finalized (checkout, “add to cart”).
3. **Flexible motivation**  
   Support both data-driven users (analytics, streaks) and low-key users (simple reflection).
4. **Align with sustainability, not overconsumption**  
   Monetization strategies must respect the “buy less, buy better” mission.

## 6. Solution – How Genie Works

Genie delivers three core benefits through its main features.

### 6.1 Daily Outfit Capture

- Users take **one quick outfit photo per day**.  
- Computer vision automatically detects **colors and categories** (e.g., “blue sweater,” “black jeans”).  
- Items are added to the **digital wardrobe**, building a realistic picture of what they actually wear.

### 6.2 Wardrobe Analytics

- Genie generates **usage statistics**, such as:
  - Wear frequency by item, color, and category
  - Cost-per-wear
  - “Most worn” vs. “never worn” items
- Users see dashboards showing:
  - Streaks
  - Days logged
  - Money saved by reusing what they already own

### 6.3 Checkout Intervention

- When a user is about to buy something online, Genie appears as a **checkout pop-up** (similar to Honey):
  - Pulls the product image and details
  - Shows **similar items** in the user’s wardrobe
  - Prompts the user to **build 3 outfits** using existing clothes
- Genie estimates whether this will be a **high-value or low-value** purchase based on past behavior and wardrobe gaps.

### 6.4 Engagement & Incentives

- **Streaks** for daily outfit logging  
- **Notifications** that celebrate:
  - Days saved
  - Money saved
  - Items worn more often  
- Gentle reminders emphasizing **benefits** (“You’ve saved $847 by rewearing items”) rather than guilt.

## 7. Ideal User Journey

We mapped a day-in-the-life journey for our target user:

1. **Morning – Capture**
   - Takes a quick mirror photo before leaving.
   - Genie auto-labels the outfit; streak count increases.
   - User quickly reviews stats (e.g., “89-day streak,” most-worn items).

2. **Afternoon – Temptation**
   - Scrolls social media, sees a new trend, clicks to buy a navy sweater.
   - At checkout, Genie pops up: “You already own 2 similar navy sweaters.”

3. **Intervention – Reflection**
   - Genie asks user to create potential outfits using the new item.
   - User realizes it doesn’t add anything new.
   - Decides not to buy → saves $150.

4. **Evening – Reflection**
   - Reviews graphs of color usage and items not worn in 3+ months.
   - Decides to donate or resell low-usage items.

## 8. Competitive & Ecosystem Analysis

We compared Genie to existing players such as Whering, Pause, and Save Your Wardrobe:

- Many competitors offer **digital wardrobe + basic analytics**.
- Few focus on **gamification** or **purchase-time intervention**.
- None combine:
  - Duplicate detection at checkout  
  - Streaks and habit-forming analytics  
  - Cost-per-wear insights  
  in one product.

We also mapped stakeholders:

- **Resale platforms** (Depop, ThredUp, Vinted) – potential partners for reselling underused clothes.
- **Sustainable fashion orgs** – aligned with our mission of mindful consumption.
- **Fast fashion retailers & e-commerce** – both potential collaborators and sources of friction.

## 9. Business Model

To keep incentives aligned with “buy less, buy better,” we explored:

- **Freemium model**
  - Free core functions: daily capture, basic analytics.
  - Paid Pro tier: advanced analytics, trend insights, export reports.
- **Mission-aligned partnerships**
  - Selective promotions from sustainable brands or resale platforms.
  - No generic “buy more” advertising.
- **Key costs**
  - Design & development (engineers, APIs)
  - Marketing
  - Customer support

## 10. My Contributions

In this team project, my main contributions were:

- **Problem framing**  
  Helped articulate the core problem as “unclear wardrobe reality + impulse online purchases” rather than generic “sustainable fashion.”
- **Research synthesis**  
  Organized qualitative insights into clear user pain points and design implications (e.g., low-effort capture, semi-automatic wardrobe, flexible motivation).
- **Interaction design & flows**
  - Designed the **daily capture → analytics → checkout intervention** flow.
  - Defined what appears in the **checkout pop-up** (similar items, outfit prompts, cost-per-wear).
- **Information design for analytics**  
  Sketched and iterated on the analytics dashboard (wear frequency by color, most-worn items, cost-per-wear).
- **Pitch deck & storytelling**  
  Co-authored the elevator pitch and business model canvas; structured the final presentation to clearly connect user pain points, Genie’s features, and impact.

## 11. Outcomes & Learnings

Although Genie was a course project, it helped us clarify how **behavior change** in fashion consumption could be nudged:

- **Interventions work best at “micro-moments”**  
  Designing around the moment of “Add to Cart” is more powerful than generic advice after the purchase.
- **Data is motivating when it is personal and actionable**  
  Cost-per-wear and streaks only matter when they connect to concrete decisions (“Should I buy this?” “Should I sell that?”).
- **Sustainability can be framed positively**  
  Users respond better to “money saved / items maximized” than to guilt-driven messaging.

### Future Directions

For future iterations, I would like to:

- Prototype the **browser extension / in-app checkout plug-in** to test real-time interventions.
- Conduct **usability testing** with actual online shoppers to validate which metrics (cost-per-wear, duplicates, environmental impact) drive the strongest behavior change.
- Explore **social but low-pressure features**, such as sharing selected stats with close friends instead of public outfit voting.
